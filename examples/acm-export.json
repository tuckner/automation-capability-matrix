OAuth is a protocol used to grant access to resources, such as APIs or web services, on behalf of a user. By understanding the permission scopes that an OAuth application requests, organizations can ensure that the application is not requesting access to sensitive or unnecessary data. Additionally, by evaluating the reputation of an OAuth client ID, organizations can determine whether the client is a trusted source or if it has a history of security issues or malicious activity. This can help to prevent users from granting access to untrusted or potentially malicious applications, which can help to protect against data breaches or other security incidents. Overall, knowing what permission scopes an OAuth application requests and the reputation of an OAuth client ID is important for ensuring the security and privacy of users in a security operations center.",

For example, a slash command could be used to quickly retrieve the status of a security system or to trigger an incident response without requiring the user to navigate through a complex series of menus or enter long and potentially error-prone commands.
